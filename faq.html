        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <div class="question">What is Drawing with Russians?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing with Russians is a non-instructed figure drawing salon, loosely, or culturally, affiliated with Russian speakers, followed by an after-party.</div>

        <div class="question">This FAQ is long, should I read the entire thing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we ask you to read this entire FAQ to avoid asking too many questions. The most interesting ones are towards the end, but don't skip the middle.</div>

        <div class="question">When is Drawing with Russians?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing with Russians is on the first Thursday of every month, except when otherwise. Doors open at <strike>7pm</strike>, 5:30pm, and close at 6:30pm, or when we're at capacity, whichever comes first. Just like most good things in Russia, the after party ends abruptly at 10:00pm.</div>

        <div class="question">Why is this event called "Drawing with Russians"?</div>
        <div class="answer">The host coined the name in 2015 while attending a figure drawing gathering almost exclusively composed of Russian speakers, and organized by another Russian-speaking artist.</div>

        <div class="question">Why didn't you rename the event after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022?</div>
        <div class="answer">The war in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ is a tragedy, and we stand with the people of Ukraine. Russia has gifted the world tremendous art and culture, along with its share of murderers, brought to power with the hands of its people that often supported their crimes, chose to, couldn't, or wouldn't resist. This is the truth. We still admire Russian culture and didn't want to hide our origins by changing the name of the event.</div>

        <div class="question">When is the next drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hIafhj" target="_blank">sign up</a> for our mailing list and we'll send you an invitation about a week in advance, followed by a confirmation within 24 hours of the event.</div>

        <div class="question">I can't wait for the next first Thursday. What can I do?</div>
        <div class="answer">The organizer also hosts a figure drawing session in Hells Hitchen at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/enochs.nyc" target="_blank">Enoch's Coffee Shop</a> every Monday 6:30pm-9pm. It's the same vibe minus the after-party, and no RSVP required. Subscribe to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/enochs.nyc" target="_blank">their IG</a> for updates.</div>

        <div class="question">What happens at figure drawing with Russians during drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">We socialize, drink wine (for those who drink), and draw a model in 20-minute intervals for about 2 hours. Short poses first, long poses last.</div>

        <div class="question">What are the rules during drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">We obey Russian prison rules. No photos of the model, no talking, not even whispering, and you must draw, no exceptions. If you do not want to draw, please do not come.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I come to Drawing with Russians even though I am not Russian?</div>
        <div class="answer">While encouraged, you do not have to be Russian or a Russian speaker to come. Typically, most attendees are not Russian, but we would be happy to <a href="books.html">recommend some books</a> before your first visit.</div>

        <div class="question">I am not Russian and don't speak Russian, but I have read Nabokov from your above-mentioned list. Will I feel out of place?</div>
        <div class="answer">You will feel right at home. If you do want to blend in, we recommend wearing a fur coat or bringing your emotional support rabbit with you.</div>

        <div class="question">Do the <a href="/books.html">recommended books</a> all have steamy or political connotations?</div>
        <div class="answer">These books are related to Russian women that tend to create problems for themselves, and then unsuccessfully attempt to resolve them, trains, duels, and William Burroughs being mean to cats.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a dress code?</div>
        <div class="answer">There is no dress code, but we recommend dressing in layers that can be easily removed as heat rises.</div>

        <div class="question">I read in one of the Obshchestvo "Pamyat" publications that most Russian emigrants are Zionist ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± imperialists. Is this event organized by one of them?</div>
        <div class="answer">The organizer was born in Moscow and has experienced first hand being a minority in the USSR. This comes with strong opinions about welcoming people from all backgrounds, faiths, and drawing skills. Sadly, we do not collect a monthly paycheck from the industrial military complex, only suggested donations.</div>

        <div class="question">Do I need a referral to come to Drawing with Russians?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we grow exclusively through word of mouth. Please tell us who referred you when <a href="http://eepurl.com/hIafhj" target="_blank">subscribing</a> to the list.</div>

        <div class="question">I never heard of this. Why was I invited?</div>
        <div class="answer">Someone, a friend or possibly a foe, decided to take the risk of referring you here. To quote Anna Akhmatova, "You will hear thunder and remember me, And think: she wanted storms."</div>

        <div class="question">I can't draw to save my life, I don't know how. Should I still come?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes enthusiastically. We don't expect you to draw well, nor to speak French fluently as most properly educated Russians. And while we do occasionally host professional artists, we see a lot more beginners.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a model?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, there is a model, and they are paid to pose with your suggested donations of $25 per person. Sometimes we have two models.</div>

        <div class="question">Is the model nude?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, very.</div>

        <div class="question">Is the model male or female?</div>
        <div class="answer">We have both female and male models.</div>

        <div class="question">Do you announce your models in advance?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we do, when we send the invitation about a week in advance.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I model at Drawing with Russians?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we hire models exclusively from attendees. Please attend an event, and mention to the host that you would like to pose, then reach out via e-mail at the bottom of this FAQ to set a date.</div>

        <div class="question">When you have two models, do they interact or are they posing in different corners of the space?</div>
        <div class="answer">Humans are social creatures and tend to cling together in occasionally scandalous ways. Our models are no exception to this rule.</div>

        <div class="question">I am posing at the next Drawing with Russians? What do I need to know?</div>
        <div class="answer">Be responsive, communicate promptly with the organizer. Arrive ahead of schedule. No model has flaked since the beginning of this event, you do not want to be the first. Your first poses should be full of movement. Face a different direction for each new pose.</div>

        <div class="question">How long is the drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing is 2 hours with breaks every 20 minutes. We start with 5x short 1-minute poses, 5x 5-minute poses, 3x 10-minute poses, and finish with 2x 20-minute ones.</div>

        <div class="question">Do I need to bring paper and crayons?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, please bring your own supplies. That said, we will have pencils and paper available for those that come without their own for any reason.</div>

        <div class="question">What kind of supplies do you recommend?</div>
        <div class="answer">We recommend a drawing pad, pencils, or charcoal.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I bring a canvas and use paint?</div>
        <div class="answer">You can draw on any dry material and use watercolor. Bring a support cloth if you use wet paints. We will supply water. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate permanently messy materials, such as oils.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I talk during drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Absolutely not. Drawing is quiet. No whispering. Please wait for a break to talk to others.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I just observe drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, you must draw. Please do not come if you do not intend to draw and are just here for the party, or plan to be texting on your phone during poses.</div>

        <div class="question">Do I need to be vaccinated against COVID-19?</div>
        <div class="answer">We won't check. That said, if you aren't vaccinated you either have a medical reason, or are out of your mind.</div>

        <div class="question">Will I have to wear a mask during drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, you will not need to wear a mask, and expect people to not be wearing one. The space is tight and there will be 50+ people. Germophobes, homophobes, racists, and those with related medical conditions should abstain from coming.</div>

        <div class="question">Where is drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing is in Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York, at the host's home and art studio. At times we were looking for a new space to accommodate more people, and have attempted, and failed, to move to a bigger space in Bushwick, Brooklyn, USSR. Personal invitations always include all the location details.</div>

        <div class="question">How will I know who the host is?</div>
        <div class="answer">The host is the one who runs the timer and makes announcements.</div>

        <div class="question">How much does drawing cost?</div>
        <div class="answer">We suggest a $25 donation. This is not a for-profit business. Money is used to pay the model, the space, dealing with building complaints, and alcohol.</div>

        <div class="question">Isn't Russian economy growing? Wasn't it $20 during Perestroika?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, Russian economy is always growing, except when otherwise. We used to ask for $20, but the Ruble has suffered from Western sanctions, causing inflation and expensive incidents resulting in building fines.</div>

        <div class="question">How many people usually come to drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">We have had the pleasure of hosting up to 60 people, which is the absolute maximum we can handle the same night. Typically, half stay for the after-party.</div>

        <div class="question">How can I pay?</div>
        <div class="answer">Bring $25 cash. We will also provide Venmo information during the event. Please remember that we have files on you and your loved ones in the unfortunate event that you forget to pay.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I pay more than $25?</div>
        <div class="answer">Thank you, yes. We commonly host Russian oligarchs, and will not be inquiring about how you made your fortune.</div>

        <div class="question">Do I need to RSVP?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we ask you to please RSVP by replying to the invitation e-mail. You must RSVP or decline to stay on the list. List purges based on arbitrary criteria come unexpected. Please read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956" target="_blank">"The Gulag Archipelago" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a> for more information.</div>

        <div class="question">What is the drawing vibe?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing is quiet. The vibe is chill. The breaks are social. The after party is bohemian.</div>

        <div class="question">Should I also bring alcohol?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, you should bring a bottle of something. In Russia we never go to a house empty-handed. We enjoy socializing during breaks, and drawing is followed by an after-party. We'd rather give all the money to the model, too, and not spend it on booze.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I bring a friend?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, it's better to have 100 friends than 100 rubles. Tell them to bring a bottle of wine.</div>

        <div class="question">Are MFA students allowed?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, as long as they are young and innocent.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I bring my child to drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, children are not permitted, this is a 21+ event.</div>

        <div class="question">Are pets allowed?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, but no dogs or cats.</div>

        <div class="question">I'm an art or physics student. Will I run into one of my professors?</div>
        <div class="answer">We cannot guarantee this one way or another. Please note that Drawing with Russians is not a graded class.</div>

        <div class="question">Is this a "drink and draw"?</div>
        <div class="answer">It certainly looks like one, but we don't like that name. You must drink responsibly or we will ask you to leave. If you drive, don't drink at all.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there music?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we generally play meditative Russian electronic music via SoundCloud, and an occasional <a href="https://soundcloud.com/omich1920/vd6bhjcnlcmr">classic from the 90s</a>. Our 2025 playlist is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dblockdotorg/sets/drawing-with-russians-2025" target="_blank">here</a>, 2024 playlist <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dblockdotorg/sets/drawing-with-russians-2024" target="_blank">here</a>, 2023 playlist <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dblockdotorg/sets/drawing-with-russians-2023" target="_blank">here</a>, and the original one is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dblockdotorg/sets/drawing-with-russians" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I still come if I'm late?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, as long as it's during the drawing part, but know that the event gets full, and we may have reached capacity. Walk in quietly, and wait for the next break to setup.</div>

        <div class="question">How do I get in? Should I ring the doorbell?</div>
        <div class="answer">Please dial 1004 on the intercom downstairs. There are two doors. Be patient, especially if you're not on time. The host checks the building door camera regularly after drawing has started, but the doorbell is off. If others are walking in, or a door person is holding the door, please mention where you're going and walk in.</div>

        <div class="question">Do I have to take my shoes off?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes. We have a coat rack and you should leave shoes under the rack.</div>

        <div class="question">Do you have space for a big bag?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, space is very limited. While we can't stop you from bringing your entire life to drawing, we highly recommend you travel unbearably light. Please be kind and avoid bringing your luggage.</div>

        <div class="question">Do you have any social media?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, please follow <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/artdblockdotorg">@artdblockdotorg</a> on Instagram. You will find some videos and photos from prior events there.</div>

        <div class="question">How will I know how much time is left in each pose?</div>
        <div class="answer">The host runs a timer with big white counting down digits that turn red during the last minute. Unlike in Cheboksary, everyone gets the same amount of time to draw.</div>

        <div class="question">When did "Drawing with Russians" start?</div>
        <div class="answer">The event became a regular affair in the early post-isolation phase of the 2021 pandemic. We've now hosted over 40.</div>

        <div class="question">Do you make a unique flyer for every Drawing with Russians occurrence?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes. Click "invites" on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a> to see them. You can also buy some OG ones as 1/1 NFTs <a href="https://rarible.com/artdblockdotorg" target="_blank">on Rarible</a>. The <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:376823">first one</a> was sold to a major collector. Ape in.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I take photos during drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, you cannot take photos during a pose without prior agreement with the model. If you see someone taking photos of our model, please let the host know ASAP. The FSB will check their phone for us.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there enough light, or a view?</div>
        <div class="answer">The loft has bright lights, 10 windows, and a largely unobstructed view of the Empire State building, including from the bathtub.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there food and can I bring dinner?</div>
        <div class="answer">Absolutely not. This is Drawing with Russians in Manhattan, not a buffet show at Tatiana in Brighton Beach. Residents of Povolzhye do not want to watch you eat, therefore please don't bring any food, unless you have received special permission to bring donuts.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a liquor store where I can buy wine?</div>
        <div class="answer">Just like in Russia, there is a liquor store within half a block in every direction. Unlike Russia, liquor stores don't run out of alcohol.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a grocery store where I can buy beer?</div>
        <div class="answer">Unlike Russia, there's a grocery store and a deli at every end of the block. If you go to the grocery store, please ask whether the person standing in line in front of you likes to draw.</div>

        <div class="question">How tall is your tallest plant?</div>
        <div class="answer">The tallest plant is a 10ft tall Bird of Paradise and was a generous gift by the artist Younhee Paik. She had a studio in the building before moving to California.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a place to smoke?</div>
        <div class="answer">The Hudson Yards building is non-smoking, including the roof. You may not smoke out of the windows and will need to take cigarettes downstairs. Please ask for a FOB to re-enter the building if you need to smoke, step 15 feet away from the building entrance, and do not hold the door open. We don't mind devices that don't emit any smell.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a bathroom?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, however, you may find it lacks similar privacy features compared to typical bathrooms. You will be able to see whether someone is using it, and if you squint, you can see the Empire State Building from the bathtub.</div>

        <div class="question">Am I allowed to hang in the building lobby or corridor?</div>
        <div class="answer">Please keep quiet, and do not hang out, or loiter in the building lobby, corridor, elevator, or steps outside. The building has cameras everywhere, possibly with facial recognition, inflicts hefty fines for all such activity, and we do our best to respect our neighbors.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I just come to drawing, and not stay for the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">Absolutely. We'd love it if you stayed, but on average, half the attendees leave shortly after drawing.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I just come to the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">No. We insist that you please come to the drawing, first.</div>

        <div class="question">What happens at the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing is followed by a party where people socialize over a glass of wine, and more.</div>

        <div class="question">But what actually happens at the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">You may notice people taking their clothes off and engaging in acts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_sex_in_the_USSR" target="_blank">strongly condoned since 1986 in the USSR</a>. You are in no way required to engage in anything beyond holding your glass of wine. We'd love it if you stayed for more, but only if you absolutely wanted to.</div>

        <div class="question">I like someone at the after-party I've never met before, what should I do?</div>
        <div class="answer">Tell them you like them, and ask them whether they'd like more. Unless they reply with a clear "yes", they mean "no". Since we're not actually in Russia, you must respect their choice.</div>

        <div class="question">Someone at the after-party asked me for my permission to touch my hand, how should I respond?</div>
        <div class="answer">Unlike Russia, you can exercise your rights here. Say "no" if you're not sure. Say "yes" if you are sure, you would like that. Stay safe.</div>

        <div class="question">Someone at the after-party is behaving in ways that aren't appropriate, such as not asking for permission to engage with someone they don't know, or just got drunk and is being disruptive, who do I tell?</div>
        <div class="answer">You can always call the person out, but please do interrupt the host in whatever they are doing, and tell them immediately. We will deal with any situation and they will be uninvited.</div>

        <div class="question">Have you begun enforcing the mayor Adams' administration New York trash containerization rules of 2023?</div>
        <div class="answer">Having had the unpleasant experience of taking un-bagged trash out to an overflowing container in the streets of Moscow in the scorching summer heat, we have decided to position multiple NYC sanitation compliant trash bins around the space. Please put your trash in them. Do pay extra attention to perishables, wrappers, sharps, and PPE.</div>

        <div class="question">What do I do if I accidentally spill a glass of wine or break one?</div>
        <div class="answer">Even though a broken glass is a good reminder of the fragility of our relationships, and that we must treat our loved ones with special care, please do cleanup after yourself. Additionally, we kindly ask you to refrain from reenacting Peter the Great who threw and broke an unbreakable faceted glass in the late 17th century after getting drunk.</div>

        <div class="question">When is it time to leave the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">We now close at 10:00pm. Signs of a good time to leave include multiple people helping clean up the place (you can help), putting their clothes back on, and the music getting very quiet. Please don't keep acting like it's not happening.</div>

        <div class="question">Am I allowed to crash on your Roche Bobois couch after the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, the 12-foot-long sectional is exclusively reserved for your enjoyment during drawing and the after-party.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I retrieve an item I left at drawing? Do you operate a lost and found?</div>
        <div class="answer">Personal sketchbooks, boxes of crayons, pencil cases, backpacks, bags of tricks, IDs, headphones, phones, devices that ring or vibrate, wallets, scarves, jackets and sweaters will be saved, and can be retrieved upon request. Most sketches and underclothes will be discarded, and will not be sold on EBay. Loss of dignity cannot be returned. If you came with a drawing partner and forgot them at the party, you will be uninvited.</div>

        <div class="question">I love the FAQ, but it's not in Russian. Can I contribute an unanswered question or a translation?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes. We accept pull requests on <a href="https://github.com/dblock/drawingwithrussians.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</div>

        <div class="question">Who can I ask more questions?</div>
        <div class="answer">Please e-mail drawing[at]drawingwithrussians[dot]com or DM <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/artdblockdotorg">@artdblockdotorg</a> on IG.</div>
