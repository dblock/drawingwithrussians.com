        <h3>Posing</h3>
        <div class="question">I am posing at the next Drawing with Russians? What do I need to know?</div>
        <div class="answer">Be responsive, communicate promptly with the organizer. Arrive ahead of schedule. No model has flaked since the beginning of this event, you do not want to be the first.</div>

        <div class="question">How is the session structured?</div>
        <div class="answer">The organizer will explain the house rules (no photos, add money to the jar, no talking). 
            Timing is as follows:
            <div class="posing">
                <div class="break"><strong>[START]</strong></div>
                <div class="pose">5 x 1-minute poses</div>
                <div class="pose">3 x 5-minute poses</div>
                <div class="break"><strong>[BREAK]</strong></div>
                <div class="pose">2 x 5-minute poses</div>
                <div class="pose">1 x 10-minute pose</div>
                <div class="break"><strong>[BREAK]</strong></div>
                <div class="pose">2 x 10-minute poses</div>
                <div class="break"><strong>[BREAK]</strong></div>
                <div class="pose">1 x 20-minute pose</div>
                <div class="break"><strong>[AFTER PARTY]</strong></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">What should I bring with me?</div>
        <div class="answer">Robe or cover-up (before taking the posing stand, during breaks, and for the after-party), wet wipes (for freshening up), props (if discussed with the organizer), and something to drink (whatever gives you strength to pose).</div>

        <div class="question">What should I do to prepare?</div>
        <div class="answer">Practice at home. Stand in front of a mirror, grab a timer, and gauge how it feels to hold your body in different positions for varying lengths of time. Share your socials with the organizer if you seek to grow your media empire.</div>

        <div class="question">What about personal grooming?</div>
        <div class="answer">Arrive clean, but skip the body moisturizer (you don't want to slip while holding a pose). With regard to hair removal, this seemingly personal practice has, in fact, profoundly influenced science, medicine, business, and even warfare—prompting enormous outlays of money, emotion, and environmental impact. Consider your personal values and comfort when making such decisions.</div>

        <div class="question">How should I pose?</div>
        <div class="answer">TL;DR your first poses should be full of movement. Face a different direction for each new pose. Additional guidance below.</div>

        <div class="question">Where can I find inspiration for my poses?</div>
        <div class="answer">Through your posture, expression, and interaction with space, you can convey narratives, emotions, and character, transforming a static pose into a dynamic scene. You may find it helpful to mine inspiration from the following sources: 1) your body/features, 2) art/fashion, 3) sports/movement practices, and 4) sensuality/kink.</div>

        <div class="question">What should I do during breaks?</div>
        <div class="answer">Prioritize your own comfort. If you need to rest, stretch, hydrate, or use the restroom, do that. Feel free to wander around the room to admire everyone's hard work and/or make new friends.</div>

        <div class="question">Do you have any final modeling tips?</div>
        <div class="answer">Take a couple seconds to find each pose. Trust the organizer to start the timer when it looks like you've “settled” in. Be still. For the longer poses (e.g., 20 minutes), remember that you're only human, and it's ok to adjust and return to a pose if needed.</div>

        <div class="question">What are the compositional elements of a pose?</div>
        <div class="answer"> You are using your body to create shapes and lines, and to communicate expression. Here are 8 basic principles to keep in mind while creating those shapes and lines.
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Balance & Stability: Holding a stable pose is crucial. Don't pick something you can't hold.</li>
                <li>Vertical vs Horizontal: Emphasize height and upward extension (vertical), or width and groundedness (horizontal). Consider the overall flow and direction of energy. Reserve seated or laying poses for the longer 10- or 20-minute poses.</li>
                <li>Stretch vs Compact: Elongate the limbs and torso, creating open space and dynamic lines (stretch)? Or crumple inward, creating a sense of containment, tension, or introspectiveness (compact)?</li>
                <li>Weight Distribution: Consider how weight distribution creates stability, balance, or a sense of impending motion. (e.g., contrapposto, where the weight of the body unevenly distributed along the hips).</li>
                <li>Tension: The presence and placement of muscular engagement, either active (e.g., a flexed muscle, a held balance) or implied (e.g., the tautness of a muscle, the strain in a gesture). Tension adds drama, strength, or vulnerability to the form. It's about where energy is held or released within the pose.</li>
                <li>Gesticulation & Articulation: The expressive use of the hands, feet, and extremities to convey emotion, narrative, or simply refine the pose. The "devil is in the details"—extending through fingertips and toes, articulating wrists and ankles, can transform a static form into an elegant, living line. This is where the subtle nuances of human expression reside (e.g., dance, gymnastics, springboard diving).</li>
                <li>Eye Contact: Is it better to close your eyes, seeking a calm internal retreat? Or to keep them open, letting them dance freely around the room, perhaps catching the gaze of a potential admirer and savoring the delicious tension?</li>
                <li>Rotation & Room Awareness: How the body is turned and angled within the space, interacting with light from the windows, or shadow from the overhead light. Think about how rotating a shoulder, tilting the head, or turning the torso can catch a highlight, create depth, or direct the viewer's eye. Also, consider how the pose's rotation might appear differently from various viewpoints, especially depending on where the artists are positioned in the room.</li>
            </ol>
        </div> 

        <div class="question">I appreciate the theoretical framework, but I'm having trouble synthesizing all this information and want concrete examples of how I should pose. Can you help?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes. Below is a sample set of 15 poses. Please use this for inspiration only. Copycats are viewed with deep suspicion, potentially seen as saboteurs undermining innovation or ideological purity.

                <div class="pose">Pose 8: Seated - Straddle Twist</div>
                <div class="description">Straddle the chair and twist (e.g., facing right). Both knees should be bent, feet flat on the floor, ideally both facing the same direction as your body. Gently twist your torso left to look over the back of the chair. Use arms to generate more torque and activate muscles.</div>
                <div class="transition">Unwind from the twist, stand.</div>

                <div class="break"><strong>[BREAK AND BEGIN 2 x 5's]</strong></div>

                <div class="pose">Pose 9: Slight Arch</div>
                <div class="description">Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Place your hands gently on your lower back, fingers pointing down or up. Inhale, gently lift your chest towards the ceiling, and allow your shoulders to draw back slightly, opening across your collarbones. Your gaze can remain forward or tilt slightly upward, avoiding any strain in your neck. Feel a subtle arch in your upper back, not a deep bend. The goal is to create a slight curve in the spine.</div>
                <div class="transition">Straighten spine and ask for chair.</div>

                <div class="pose">Pose 10: Seated - Arms Outstretched</div>

                <div class="pose">Pose 11: Waiting in Line</div>
                <div class="description">Stand with feet comfortably wide, perhaps slightly wider than shoulder-width. Gently lean your upper body to one side (e.g., to the right), allowing your hips to shift slightly in the opposite direction (to the left) for balance. Your arms can hang naturally at your sides, or one hand can rest lightly on your hip. Feel a gentle stretch along the side of your torso without straining. Keep your gaze soft and forward. This is a very subtle lean, not an aggressive bend.</div>
                <div class="transition">Gently return to a neutral standing position, then slowly make your way to a comfortable seated position.</div>

                <div class="pose">Pose 12: Seated Gentle Hinge</div>
                <div class="description">Sit on the chair. Gently hinge forward from your hips, letting your torso relax towards your thighs. Your hands can rest on your knees, shins, or dangle towards the floor. Allow your head to hang heavy, relaxing your neck. This provides a gentle stretch for the back and hamstrings.</div>

                <div class="break"><strong>[BREAK AND BEGIN 1 x 20]</strong></div>

                <div class="pose">Pose 13: Sit</div>
                <div class="description">Consider how to interact with the chair and position your body in a way that is both comfortable and sustainable for your body. Feel free to ask for a cushion or pillow if needed.</div>
